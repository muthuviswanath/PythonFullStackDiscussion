Purpose of the constructor is to create or to construct an object
Constructors can also be used to initialize the class instance variables at the time of object creation
Constructor Types:
    Default Constructor
    Non-Parameterized Constructor
    Parameterized Constructor
Every class comes with an automatic constructor called as default constructor.
The default constructor can be called explicitly outside the class
A constructor can be created by the developers explicitly. Those are Non-Parameterized Constructor, Parameterized Constructor
To create a constructor - Syntax:

Non-Parameterized Constructor:
    def __init__(self):
        statements
Parameterized Constructor:
    def __init__(self,variable):
        statements
There is nothing called as constructor overloading
If the user creates a constructor, then there wont be any default constructor
