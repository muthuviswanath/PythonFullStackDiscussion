Class:
    Class is a blueprint of an object
    Class is used to help in constructing the object
    Class is a logical entity that has no physical existence
    Class is a non-primitive data type

Object:
    It is a real world physical entity which can be seen or touched or felt and which has mass and occupies space.
    To create an object class is required
    More than one object can be created out of the same class / blueprint
    All the objects that are created using the same class / blueprint can be called as similar objects
    Modifying or destroying an object that is created using the same class / blueprint will not affect the other objects
    An object can have multiple references
    One that is used to describe about the object is called as states or properties of the object and it is represented as variables
    One that is used to describe the functionality of the object is called as behaviour it is represented as methods
