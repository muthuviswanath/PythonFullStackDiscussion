Inheritance:
    It is a phenomenon where a class inherits the proeprties and behaviors of another class. 
    In which, the class that inherits the proeprties and behaviors is called as "Sub Class / Derived  Class / Child Class".
    The class whose proeprties and behaviors are inherited is called as "Super Class / Base Class / Parent Class".
    When a method is overridden, the implementation of the method is always called from the derived class only.

Types of Inheritance:

    Single Level Inheritance
    Multi-Level Inheritance
    
    Hierarchical Inheritance
    Multiple Inheritance
    Hybrid Inheritance
