Method Resolution Order
    In multiple inheritance, a specific attribute or poperty or method will be searched in the current class. 
    If it is not found in the current class, it searches in the parent class.
    This search order is called as Method Resolution Order.


                            

MRO Principle:


                            class A:

                            class B (A):

                            class C (B):

    1. Is is to search in the current class before going to the base/parent/super class. If class B is inherited from A, then the class B
    will be searched first and then if it is not found in class B then it will search in class A.

                            class A:

                            class B:

                            class C:
                            
                            class D(A,C,B):

    2. If a class is inherited from several classes, then it searched from left to right in the way of inheritance.
    So in this above case, the search will happen in class A then in C and then in B


    3. Once a class is visited, it will not be visited again.
